A Component can only return a single top level xml because
1. Make it easy to do reconciliation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A re-render means that
1.React did some work to calaulate what all should update in this component.
2.The component actually got called, function got called by React
3.The inspector shows you a bounding box around the component.

It happens when
1. A state variable that is being used inside a component changes.
2. A parent component re-render triggers all childern re-rendering.

You want to minimize the number of re-renders to make a highly optimal react app 
--> push the state down make the static one aside and dynamic one other side
The more the component that are getting re-renderd, the worse
