# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## sideEffect
- the concept of side effect encompasses any oprations that react outside the functional scope of a react component. These operations can effect other componets, interact with the browser , or perform asynchronous data fetching 

## Hooks
- Hooks allow us to use state and other React features without writing a class.
- They enable functional component to have access to stateful logic and lifecycle features, this things were previously in class components in previous versions.
